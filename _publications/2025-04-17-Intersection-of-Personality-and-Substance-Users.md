### Objective:
To evaluate whether the associations between the Big Five personality traits and SU discourse shifted during the 2019â€“2021 period, and to conduct a focused analysis of how these traits predict SU and relate to specific substance types, emotional expression, and demographic factors.

### Methods:
We analyzed a corpus of several hundred million public posts from a major social media platform from 2019 to 2021. Using a pipeline of natural language processing and deep learning models, we identified SU-related posts and subsequently extracted scores for the Big Five personality traits, emotions, and user demographics. We employed trend analysis to compare annual shifts in trait-SU associations, while detailed 2020 data underwent rigorous modeling using logistic regression, correlation analysis, and topic modeling to elucidate the core relationships.
