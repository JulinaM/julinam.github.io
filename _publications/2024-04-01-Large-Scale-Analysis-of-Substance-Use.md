### Objective:
This work aimed to more accurately identify substance related posts, including references to specific drug types and utilization, and the purpose of drug use from large-scale social media data by training a deep learning model to monitor trends in temporal and spatial dimensions.

### Methods:
Our method used self trained deep learning model on huge social media data to identify the post related to drug use followed by various statistical methods like k-means, LDA topic analysis, thematic analysis.
